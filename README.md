## Features

- **Automated Build Process**: Uses Jenkins and Maven to automate the compilation and packaging of Java applications.
- **Continuous Testing**: Runs unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
- **Docker Containerization**: Packages the application in a Docker container, creating a consistent deployment environment.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploys the containerized application to a Kubernetes cluster, enabling scalability and high availability.
- **End-to-End CI/CD Automation**: Orchestrates each stage of the pipeline, from code commit to deployment, ensuring efficiency and reliability.

## Prerequisites

To use this CI/CD pipeline, youâ€™ll need the following tools installed and configured:

1. **Jenkins** (with plugins):
   - Git Plugin
   - Maven Integration Plugin
   - Pipeline Plugin
   - Kubernetes Continuous Deploy Plugin

2. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 11 or higher)
3. **Maven** (for building the Java project)
4. **Docker** (for containerization)
5. **Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - For local testing, Minikube can be used.
   - For production, a managed Kubernetes service (e.g., AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Azure AKS) is recommended.
6. **Git** (for version control and repository management)
